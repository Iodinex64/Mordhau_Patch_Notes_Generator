Strike->stab morphs will now force the stab to use the same angle as the strike, making the action more natural looking and less snappy
Attack turn compensation is now enabled in all directions (previously depended on angle, e.g. horizontals had no up-down compensation, and overheads had no left-right compensation). - this will make certain cases more readable and no longer instant hit

Attack lunge now decreases gradually after 105cm weapon range (Longsword) - this means that the longest weapons now have the least amount lunge
Miss recovery is now based on weapon length and speed or "weight" - this means that short one handed weapons now have significantly less miss recovery, making them much more nimble and lighter in use. Longer weapons have more, making misses more punishing.

Removed overpower from non-shield ripostes, shields still have it
Ripostes no longer clash with non-ripostes
Added riposte hyperarmor - this means hitting someone who is riposting will hitstop your attack and force a short (300ms) lockout from parrying, preventing players from spamming attacks into a riposting player and instantly parrying their riposte hit trade. This will buff 1vX.
Shield wall ripostes can now be flinched (additional tweaks to shield wall will come in the future)
Can now parry out of shield wall ripostes like regular ripostes
Shield wall can now be lowered instantly with no recovery, allowing players to cancel them and start a normal attack or tap parry to get normal ripostes.

Combattest: Added new mechanic that fixes/improves missing on purpose/combo misses - aiming at enemy attack tracers when parrying will now give a much faster parry recovery when it detects an attack recovery/release/missed combo windup/environment hit (includes team hitstop) - uses a modified parry box to detect and is easy to trigger, currenly has no sound or obvious indicator
Combattest: Added riposte feint (not the final iteration as it needs animation changes)
Combattest: Attack recoveries can now be parried and will now thud when hitting characters, reducing clipping and reducing lockouts, will still count as a miss on thud
Combattest: Increased feint lockout & regular parry recovery slightly for more punishable feints
Point system changed to 48 points (point costs are raised proportionally) - this will allow for finer balance between equipment, armor and perk costs and make the armory more sandboxy
Added heavy weight debuff - this is a new weapon attribute that will slow down the player by 20 units when holding a weapon in hand that has this debuff. Right now applies to Zweihander, Spear and Halberd and Polehammer in the future.

This fixes cases where the character would sometimes do the slow pullup climb on objects that are very small and near the ground.
Can now climb on thin objects consistently as a vault
