# Mordhau Patch Notes Generator
Creates convincing Mordhau patch note leaks.

## How to use:
- Make sure both the corpus (every_mordhau_patchnote_ever.txt) is in the same folder as the python script.
- If not already installed, run `pip install markovify`
- Run the script

It will generate a "patchie.txt" - this is your randomly generated patch notes.
